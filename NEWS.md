# MrBean 2.0.9

* LSD for single-site spatial analysis with SpATS.

* Module GBLUP implemented.
  * Added a plot and a table with variance components estimates. 
  * Added the estimation of genomic heritability or marker-based heritability.
  * Added a plot for checking the accuracy of the model by trait. (Observed values vs Predicted values).
  * Added action button for downloading a summary of the analysis.
  * Added a corrPlot with the genetic correlations among traits.
  * Added a dendrogram and a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for the GEBVs.
  * Added a table with predicted.values, GEBVs, standard.errors and reliabilities for each of the genotypes and each of the traits.
  * Added a plot for comparing the GEBVs against the reliability.
  * Added action button for downloading table with predictions and GEBVs.
  * Added a tab with marker effects by trait.
  * Added a plot with Estimated Squared-Marker effect for multiple traits. In addition, if the genetic map was imported you will be able to visualize this plot with colors by chromosome (similar to a manhattan plot).
  * Added action button for downloading markers effects.
  * Added an additional window for seeing the ranking of the GEBVs.
